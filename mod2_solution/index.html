	<p>
	NOT gate can be realized through transistor.The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s base. When no voltage is present on the input, the transistor turns off. When the transistor is off, no current flows through the collector-emitter path. Thus, current from the supply voltage (Vcc) flows through resistor R1 to the output. In this way, the circuit’s output is high when its input is low.
